# AirBnB Clone V2

## Introduction

This repository is a fork of the original AirBnB_clone project, focusing on extending its functionality with additional features and improvements. The project aims to simulate the fundamental aspects of the AirBnB platform, including user management, property listings, and reservation systems, now utilizing a MySQL database for data management.

## Modifications

To be updated...

### SQL Scripts

- Use vi, vim, or emacs as editors.
- Follow SQL syntax standards and best practices.
- Include a README.md file at the root of the project folder.
- Ensure all SQL queries are accompanied by a comment explaining their purpose. For example:

```sql
-- first 3 students in Batch ID=3
-- because Batch 3 is the best!
SELECT id, name FROM students WHERE batch_id = 3 ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 3;
```
